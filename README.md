## <span style="color:#ff69b4">about me</span>

hi, i’m majda ✨  
i love math and coding, so machine learning feels like a natural fit :)  
i enjoy building models, writing clean code, and tackling projects that are smart and practical.  

i’m curious by nature, love solving problems, and i get excited when theory actually works in practice.  
this repo is my little corner to share projects, experiments, and research work — all documented so you can dive in easily
